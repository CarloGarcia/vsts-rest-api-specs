# Policy
If you havenâ€™t already, look at the information on getting started with these APIs and our documentation on [branch policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615252). Use these APIs to define policies for your projects. 
Configurations associate a type, such as "Required reviewers", with specific settings, such as  "For pull requests with files named *.dll targeting the master branch in the Fabrikam Git repository, add the Source-Controlled Binaries Team as a required reviewer". 

## Common tasks

### Get a list of policy configurations

* Get the available [policy types](xref:vsts.policy.types) for an account.
* Get the [policy configurations](xref:vsts.policy.configurations) for a team project.
